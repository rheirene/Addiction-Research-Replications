# Small telescopes approach: R code for calculating effect detectable at 33% power of original study
# First, load the pwr package using the following command:
 library("pwr")

# **TO DETERMINE d33%**
  # For example paired samples t-test scenario presented in Heirene (2019):
    pwr.t.test(n = 50, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.333, type = "paired", alternative = "two.sided") # paired sample, two-sided t-test
  
  # For **t-tests**:
    pwr.t.test(n = 20, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.333, type = "one.sample", alternative = "two.sided") # one sample, two-sided t-test
    pwr.t.test(n = 20, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.333, type = "one.sample", alternative = "greater") # one sample, one-sided t-test: M1 greater than M2.
    pwr.t.test(n = 20, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.333, type = "one.sample", alternative = "less") # one sample, one-sided t-test: M1 less than M2.
  
  # Comments: Simply change the values according to the specifics of the outcome you wish to replicate. For example, change the number of participants used in the study to “n = [sample size used]”, or “one.sample” to “two.sample” for independent groups calculations. 
    # power can be set at "0.333" or "1/3", with minor variations in outcome
    
    pwr.t.test(n = 20, sig.level = 0.05, power = 1/3, type = "two.sample", alternative = "less") # two sample, one-sided t-test: M1 less than M2; n = number of particopants in each group.
    
  # For **correlations**:
    pwr.r.test(n = 20, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.333, alternative = c("two.sided")) # positive correlation 
    pwr.r.test(n = 20, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.333, alternative = c("les")) # negative correlation 

# **TO DETERMINE sample size needed to detect d33%**
  # For example paired samples t-test scenario presented in Heirene (2019):
    pwr.t.test(d = 0.22, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.80, type = "paired", alternative = "two.sided") # one sample, two-sided t-test, with 80% power to detect d33%
    
    # For **t-tests**:
    pwr.t.test(d = 0.36, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.80, type = "one.sample", alternative = "two.sided") # one sample, two-sided t-test, with 80% power to detect d33%
    
    # For **correlations**:
    pwr.r.test(r = 0.5, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.80, alternative = c("two.sided")) # positive correlation, with 80% power to detect d33%
